## Project Overview

This project explores smoking habits in the UK through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, using Python and common data science libraries.  
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, was analyzed to uncover trends in behavior, with a personal motivation: to better understand smoking patterns as part of my own journey toward living a healthier, smoke-free life.

    The dataset was cleaned and explored to extract statistical summaries — including mean, median, and mode — for features such as age and smoking frequency on weekends.

## Key Features

- Performed **data cleaning and preprocessing** to prepare the dataset for analysis.  
- Conducted both **univariate** and **multivariate** analysis to examine the relationships between variables.  
- Used Python libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib** to create insightful visualizations.  
- Derived meaningful **statistical insights** about smoking behavior using measures of central tendency and dispersion.
