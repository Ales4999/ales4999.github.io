## Project Overview

This page showcases my journey as a **Division 1 athlete** on the **University of Colorado Boulder Men’s Rugby Team**, where I balanced elite athletics with an intense academic workload in engineering and computer science.

Rugby wasn’t just a sport — it was a discipline that shaped my mindset, resilience, and approach to challenges both on the field and in the lab.

## My Journey

I had the opportunity to compete with the **CU Division 1 Rugby Team** during my sophomore year of college.  
I played two seasons, primarily at **outside center** and **left wing**, positions that demanded speed, spatial awareness, and physical endurance.

During the second season, I suffered a **concussion** that forced me to make a difficult decision — to step away from the game to prioritize my long-term health and well-being.  
It was one of the hardest choices I’ve made, but also one of the most responsible.

Rugby gave me everything — strength, structure, friendships, and a sense of belonging. And though I ultimately had to hang the boots for good, I carry those lessons forward every day.

## Training Commitment

- **Four weekly practices** focusing on phase play, defensive structure, and situational drills.
- **6:00 AM weightlifting sessions**, 2–3 times per week for explosive power and endurance.
- **Weekend matches and tournaments** against top national programs.
- **Film study and tactical meetings** every friday afternoon to refine team execution.

## Academic Balance

Balancing Division 1 rugby with a double-major curriculum taught me time management, resilience, and commitment.

- Allocated focused work blocks between classes and training.
- Kept a structured daily routine to manage both physical recovery and academic performance.
- Applied discipline from training into large technical projects and software builds.
