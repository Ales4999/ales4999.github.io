## Project Overview

Reading has been one of the most consistent and grounding habits in my life.  
I gravitate toward **non-fiction books** that challenge the way I think, stretch my worldview, and offer timeless wisdom across philosophy, science, psychology, and performance.

Whether it’s a few pages each night or an entire book on a long flight, reading helps me slow down, reflect, and reconnect with what really matters — **resilience, focus, perspective, and growth**.

## Why It Matters

Reading isn’t a passive activity for me — it’s **training for the mind**, much like lifting is for the body.  
It teaches me how to think more clearly, act with integrity, and approach life and work with perspective and intentionality.
