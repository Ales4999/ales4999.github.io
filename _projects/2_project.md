This project highlights the exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted on smoking habits in the UK, using Python and data visualization tools. 

This performed EDA on an observational dataset from Kaggle to gain a deeper understadning regarding smoking habits of people so that it may help me during my own personal journey to stop smoking and eventually live a healthier life.
