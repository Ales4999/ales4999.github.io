This project highlights my journey through my football career, including key achievements, milestones, and personal reflections on how the game has shaped me both as a player and as a person.

I started playing American Football from a very young age. It acted as a guide and a place that I know associate with safety. Inside the field, I could let go of all my problems and focus on one thing, the game. 

It served me as a way to form habits of discipline and endurance against tough conditions.

    I started playing football when I was just 8 years of age. I got the opportunity to keep playing every single year of my life until I turned 18 and finished highschool.

I started to develop as a person and a player at <a href="http://www.bucaneros.com.mx/" > Bucaneros de Sat√©lite </a>. I played in this team for 6 years, until I turned 16 and moved to the Colorado for my studies. I was part of 3 championship seasons. The last one being one I lead as team captian.

    I played as an inside linebacker, a running back, and special teams. I always played one year above me, since all my friends where a year older. I was grateful enough to have a good size as a boy in order to do this.

I had the opportunity to represent my football team league and state when I got selected to be part of the U-15 league, where we played on a national level against other state selections from Mexico.

    In this selection, I played as an outside linebacker. It was held on 2015 in Cancun Quintana Roo. It was a 2 week long event where we had games every other day.

After a succesfull U-15 event, an international game was organized to play against the US. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity, where a team was formed from a pool of all the players that participated on the previous U-15 nationwide event. Each player was evaluated and asked to try-out for a spot in the team.

The last chapter of my football career happened in Colorado, where I had the opportunity to finish my 2 remaining years high school. I played for the <a href="https://www.maxpreps.com/co/frisco/summit-tigers/football/"> Summit Tigers Football</a> team. Even though my english was not perfect, I was able to find comradeship within this team who not only accepted me, but also named me captain on my senior year.

    It was here where I grew most, getting out of my comfort zone by moving to a new country was hard. Football gave me a place where I felt safe, a place a had known for a long time, which allowed me to embrace this new change and find ways to thrive within it.
