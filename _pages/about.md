Hi, Iâ€™m Alberto! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in *Computer Science* at CU Boulder, with minors in *Business* and *Computer Engineering*. My technical expertise spans across software development, embedded systems, robotics, and data science. From programming fully autonomous robots to working on RISC-V processor modeling, I enjoy solving challenging problems through innovative solutions.

My areas of interest include Embedded Systems, Data Science, Computer Architecture, and Networking. Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work on various exciting projects, including developing a UDP client-server system, creating AI opponents for games, and exploring exploratory data analysis on UK smoking habits.

I am an international student from Mexico, and I had the privilege to come to the U.S. under an F-1 student visaâ€”a journey that has shaped both my personal and academic growth. Over the past five years, Iâ€™ve dedicated myself to mastering the English language while honing my technical and soft skills through my studies.

Although I donâ€™t yet have formal industry experience, Iâ€™ve been proactive in preparing for the professional world. Through hands-on projects, leadership roles, and academic challenges, Iâ€™ve developed a strong foundation that Iâ€™m excited to bring into my career. I'm ready to take the next step and apply my knowledge to real-world challenges, eager to learn, grow, and contribute.
