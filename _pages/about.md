## Hi, I’m Alberto!


I'm a **Computer Science student** at the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cs">University of Colorado Boulder</a>, graduating in **May 2025**, with minors in <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/business/academic-programs/minor-business">Business</a> and <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/academics/minor-computer-engineering">Computer Engineering</a>.


### My Interests 
- <a href="https://ales4999.github.io/projects/hackcu11/">Software Development</a> — I enjoy building scalable, elegant software that solves real-world problems and delivers lasting impact.


- <a href="https://ales4999.github.io/projects/tiago_sim/">Robotics</a> — I’m driven by the challenge of bringing machines to life, combining hardware and algorithms to create systems that interact with the world around them.


- <a href="https://ales4999.github.io/projects/disaster/">AI/Machine Learning</a> — I love using data to uncover insights, make smart predictions, and continuously improve system performance.


- <a href="https://ales4999.github.io/projects/stm_board/">Embedded Systems</a> — I’m passionate about programming close to the hardware to create fast, efficient systems that power smart devices.


- <a href="https://ales4999.github.io/projects/network/">Networking Systems</a> — I value designing reliable, high-performance communication systems that keep devices and people connected.

My <code>passion</code> lies in building systems that are **scalable**, **impactful**, and **reliable**. 

I’m drawn to <code>solving complex problems</code> through thoughtful design and clean code, whether that’s developing full-stack applications, working close to the hardware, or leveraging data and machine learning to drive smart solutions. 

I value systems that not only function well, but grow gracefully and make a <code>meaningful difference</code>.
